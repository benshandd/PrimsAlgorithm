# Prim's Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Trees

This repository contains a basic implementation of Prim's Algorithm in Python for finding minimum spanning trees in an undirected graph.

## Introduction

Prim's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the minimum spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph. It starts with an random vertex and then grows the tree by adding the minimum-weight edge that connects the tree to a vertex not yet in the tree. This process continues until all vertices are included in the tree.
